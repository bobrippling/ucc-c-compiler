Major C Features
################

C99 VLAs - experimental/vla branch
C99 _Complex types
C11 _Thread_local / gcc __thread
C11 _Atomic

cc1
###

cache unsigned types as well as signed types

-fno-builtin
default to external memset calls, -ffreestanding to use builtin on

cc1.h - remove unused warnings

struct initialisation
	Update all compound lit. tests with structs when parsing complete (and then designated inits when complete)

-fcommon: .comm nam,sz,align

out/gen-optimisations:
	constant folding
	rearrangement of 1+f()+1 to f() + 1 + 1 - avoid pre-call reg saves
	out/* - constant offset for symbols - x+61(%rsp), etc

X-Macros instead of switches for enums

const-fold: change interface and checking of ->val.iv.val to more explicit code
            also need type casts for overflows, etc

__alignof__/_Alignof, _Alignas(type/const-expr):
	same as sizeof except:
		doubles: { linux32 => 4, win32 => 8, linux64 => 8 }
		longs + doubles + ptrs change as their sizeof changes (x86 vs x64)
	for structs/unions, it is the alignment of the largest type

static analysis for labels - flag unused labels

phi/basic-block backend gen

bitfields: must be ints,
	can't be addressed,
	nor sizeof()'d
	also: struct x { int i : 1; : 3; } is valid (but not for the first field)

32-bit code gen

__attribute__((pure))
- function with no side effects (e.g. strlen())

stabs/dwarf debugging annotations

__attribute__((fastcall)), cdecl, etc
- see Windows name mangling - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name_mangling
[this is in the experimental/calling_conv branch]

extensions:
	namespace [str] { ... }
	classes?
	__attribute__((overloadable)) - clang

warn on more C99 uses in -std=c(89|90)|ansi:
	e.g. compound literals, _Generic, _Static_assert, etc


cpp
###

[fixes in feature/cpp/* branches]

-Wunused-macros
	warn at eof, or when the macro is redefined/undefined
	-D macros, builtin and header macros aren't warned about

-C: don't strip comments

__TIMESTAMP__

memory leaks

-Df(x)=x+1

fix dir-relative file opening (for #include <>):
	cc -E dir/x.c
	doesn't work, but
	cd dir; cc -E x.c
	does

cc -MM *.c

macros over multiple lines
	#define a(x, y) x + y
	a(
		1,
		2
	)


lib
###

stdio buffers, etc
