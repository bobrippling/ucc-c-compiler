It should be fairly obvious what this program does

It doesn't use system include files nor libraries yet, just some simple ones in lib/


Requirements
========================

nasm (I have version 2.09.10, not sure what the lowest required is)
ld (any form should be fine)

Obviously you need a compiler to compiler this compiler with.


Compiling (the compiler)
========================

./configure [--nasm=path/to/nasm]
make


Compiling C files
=================

Pretty much the standard args, cc is found in src/
All paths in cc are relative to this, so don't change it.
I haven't made an install make target yet.

All programs compiled by ucc are staticly linked.


Major C-Features Todo
=============

floating point numbers, long + short types (asm_backend_recode branch)


Examples
========

./src/cc -o hello hello.c
- preprocess, compile, assemble and link hello.c into hello

./src/cc -o- -S test.c
- output assmebly code for test.c

./src/cc -o- -S -Xprint test.c
- show the abstract parse tree with type annotation and stack offsets, etc

./src/cc -c test.c
- (preprocess) compile and assemble test.c -> test.o

./src/cc -c test.s
- assemble test.s -> test.o
(preprocessing and compilation are skipped)

./src/cc -fenglish -Xprint -o- test.c
- (-fenglish) show the abstract parse tree with output decls in english
e.g.:
	int *(*const (*x)(void))(int);
becomes:
	"x": pointer to function(taking no arguments) returning const pointer to function(int) returning pointer to int

./src/cc -E -o- test.c
- if you need to ask then read some proper compiler documentation
